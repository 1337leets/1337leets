## Hi, I'm Erhan 👋

I'm an Electrical Engineering student with a strong interest in **systems engineering**,  
**low-level programming**, and **simulation-driven problem solving**.

My work mostly revolves around understanding how systems behave at a fundamental level —
from operating systems and microprocessors to control, power, and networked systems.

---

### 🔧 Technical Interests
- Low-level programming (x86 Assembly, C/C++)
- Operating Systems & Microprocessors
- Control systems & real-time simulation
- Cybersecurity & network reconnaissance
- Game and engine modding as a systems playground

---

### 🧪 Projects & Work
Some of the things you’ll find here:
- **BareScan** — minimal, low-noise service fingerprinting tool (Python)
- **x86 Assembly Blackjack** — text-based Blackjack game written in NASM for Linux
- **CS 1.6 AMX Mod X Plugins** — gameplay and mechanic modifications
- **Windows system sound restoration** via PowerShell
- Game mods and prototypes developed during game jams (via organization contributions)

Most projects are built to explore **how things work under the hood**,  
not just to ship features.

### 🎓 Background
- Electrical Engineering student  
- Experience with MATLAB, Simulink, OPAL-RT, embedded systems, and system modeling  
- Interested in research-oriented engineering roles and applied systems work

---

### 📌 Notes
- I prefer clean, minimal designs over over-engineered solutions  
- Many projects start as experiments and evolve into tools

You can find my ongoing and experimental work across the repositories below.
